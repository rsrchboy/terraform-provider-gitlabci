# GitLabCI Provider

The GitLabCI provider allows the trivial creation of a runner token, without
requiring authentication to the GitLab instance itself.  It does this by using
the [runner registration token](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/register/) of
the project/group/instance, rather than the authentication credentials of any
specific user.

For more information, please see the [Registering a
runner](guides/registering-a-runner) guide.

For a general-purpose provider (that includes the ability to look up
registration tokens), please see the [GitLab terraform
provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/gitlab/).
