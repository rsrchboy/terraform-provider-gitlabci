# Synopsis

    provider "gitlabci" {
        base_url = "https://gitlab.com/api/v4"
    }

    resource "gitlabci_runner_token" "this" {
        registration_token = "c0ffee..."
        run_untagged       = true
        active             = true
        locked             = true
        tags               = [
            "one",

# Description

The [GitLab provider for terraform](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-gitlab) is rather nice.  However, it (currently) has
a couple limitations:

* Runners cannot be registered; and
* API tokens are required.

This is a limited functionality provider, aimed only at making it trivial to
create / destroy registered runner tokens while requiring nothing more than
the relevant [registration token](https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/api/runners.html#registration-and-authentication-tokens).
