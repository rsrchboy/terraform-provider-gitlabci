        This resource will take a registration token and use it to register a new
        runner.  Tags, etc, may be specified here at create time.

        **N.B.** Changing any parameter will force the creation of a new resource.
        _Registration info cannot be changed by this resource._

        Generally, all options are as listed at [API Doc -- "Register a new Runner"](https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/api/runners.html#register-a-new-runner).
